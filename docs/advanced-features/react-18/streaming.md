# Streaming SSR

Streaming allows you to incrementally render parts of your UI to the client.

In Next.js 13, you can start using the `app/` directory (beta) to take advantage of streaming server-rendering. Learn more by reading the `app/` directory (beta) documentation:

- [Streaming and Suspense](https://beta.nextjs.org/docs/data-fetching/streaming-and-suspense)
- [Instant Loading UI](https://beta.nextjs.org/docs/routing/loading-ui)

[Deploy the `app/` directory example](https://vercel.com/templates/next.js/app-directory) to try Streaming SSR.
