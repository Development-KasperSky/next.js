Middleware enables you to use code over configuration. This gives you full flexibility in Next.js, because you can run code before a request is completed. Based on the user's incoming request, you can modify the response by rewriting, redirecting, adding headers, or even streaming HTML.

## Usage

1. Install the latest version of Next.js:

```jsx
npm install next@latest
```

2. Then, create a `middleware.ts` file under your project root directory.

3. Finally, export a middleware function from the `middleware.ts` file.

```jsx
// middleware.ts

import type { NextRequest, NextResponse } from 'next/server'
import { areCredentialsValid } from '../lib'

export function middleware(req: NextRequest) {
  if (areCredentialsValid(req.headers.get('authorization')) {
    return NextResponse.next()
  }
  return NextResponse.redirect(new URL(`/login?from=${req.nextUrl.pathname}`, req.url))
}
```

In this example, we use the standard Web API Response ([MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Response)).

## API

Middleware is created by using a `middleware` function that lives inside a `middleware` file. Its API is based upon the native [`FetchEvent`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/FetchEvent), [`Response`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Response), and [`Request`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Request) objects.

These native Web API objects are extended to give you more control over how you manipulate and configure a response, based on the incoming requests.

The function signature:

```ts
import type { NextFetchEvent } from 'next/server'
import type { NextRequest } from 'next/server'

export type Middleware = (
  request: NextRequest,
  event: NextFetchEvent
) => Promise<Response | undefined> | Response | undefined
```

The function can be a default export and as such, does **not** have to be named `middleware`. Though this is a convention. Also note that you only need to make the function `async` if you are running asynchronous code.

Read the full [Middleware API reference](/docs/api-reference/edge-runtime.md), note [Node.js APIs are not supported in this environment](/docs/api-reference/edge-runtime.md#unsupported-apis)

## Examples

Middleware can be used for anything that shares logic for a set of pages, including:

- [Authentication](https://github.com/vercel/examples/tree/main/edge-functions)
- [Bot protection](https://github.com/vercel/examples/tree/main/edge-functions)
- [Redirects and rewrites](https://github.com/vercel/examples/tree/main/edge-functions)
- [Handling unsupported browsers](https://github.com/vercel/examples/tree/main/edge-functions)
- [Feature flags and A/B tests](https://github.com/vercel/examples/tree/main/edge-functions)
- [Advanced i18n routing requirements](https://github.com/vercel/examples/tree/main/edge-functions)

## Execution Order

Middleware runs directly after `redirects` and `headers`, before the first filesystem lookup. This excludes `/_next` files.

## Deployment

Middleware uses a [strict runtime](/docs/api-reference/edge-runtime.md) that supports standard Web APIs like `fetch`. This works out of the box using `next start`, as well as on Edge platforms like Vercel, which use [Edge Functions](http://www.vercel.com/edge).
