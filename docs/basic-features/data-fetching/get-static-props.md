# getStaticProps

If you export a function called `getStaticProps` (Static Site Generation) from a page, Next.js will pre-render this page at build time using the props returned by `getStaticProps`.

```jsx
export async function getStaticProps(context) {
  return {
    props: {}, // will be passed to the page component as props
  }
}
```

## When should I use getStaticProps?

You should use `getStaticProps` if:

- The data required to render the page is available at build time ahead of a user’s request
- The data comes from a headless CMS
- The data can be publicly cached (not user-specific)
- The page must be pre-rendered (for SEO) and be very fast — `getStaticProps` generates `HTML` and `JSON` files, both of which can be cached by a CDN for performance

When combined with [Incremental Static Regeneration](/docs/basic-features/data-fetching/incremental-static-regeneration.md), `getStaticProps` will run in the background while the stale page is being revalidated, and the fresh page served to the browser.

Because `getStaticProps` runs at build time, it does **not** have access to the incoming request (such as query parameters or `HTTP` headers) as it generates static `HTML`. If you need access to the request for your page, consider using [Middleware](/docs/middleware.md) in addition to `getStaticProps`.

## Using getStaticProps to fetch data from a CMS

The following example shows how you can fetch a list of blog posts from a CMS.

```jsx
// posts will be populated at build time by getStaticProps()
function Blog({ posts }) {
  return (
    <ul>
      {posts.map((post) => (
        <li>{post.title}</li>
      ))}
    </ul>
  )
}

// This function gets called at build time on server-side.
// It won't be called on client-side, so you can even do
// direct database queries.
export async function getStaticProps() {
  // Call an external API endpoint to get posts.
  // You can use any data fetching library
  const res = await fetch('https://.../posts')
  const posts = await res.json()

  // By returning { props: { posts } }, the Blog component
  // will receive `posts` as a prop at build time
  return {
    props: {
      posts,
    },
  }
}

export default Blog
```

The [`getStaticProps` API reference](/docs/api-reference/data-fetching/get-static-props.md) covers all parameters and props that can be used with `getStaticProps`.

## Write server-side code directly

As `getStaticProps` runs only on the server-side, it will never run on the client-side. It won’t even be included in the JS bundle for the browser, so you can write direct database queries without them being sent to browsers.

This means that instead of fetching an **API route** from `getStaticProps` (that itself fetches data from an external source), you can write the server-side code directly in `getStaticProps`.

Take the following example. An API route is used to fetch some data from a CMS. That API route is then called directly from `getStaticProps`. This produces an additional call, reducing performance. Instead, the logic for fetching the data from the CMS can be moved to `getStaticProps`.

Alternatively, if you are **not** using API routes to fetch data, then the [`fetch()`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Fetch_API) API _can_ be used directly in `getStaticProps` to fetch data.

To verify what Next.js eliminates from the client-side bundle, you can use the [next-code-elimination tool](https://next-code-elimination.vercel.app/).

## Statically generates both HTML and JSON

When a page with `getStaticProps` is pre-rendered at build time, in addition to the page HTML file, Next.js generates a JSON file holding the result of running `getStaticProps`.

This JSON file will be used in client-side routing through [`next/link`](/docs/api-reference/next/link.md) or [`next/router`](/docs/api-reference/next/router.md). When you navigate to a page that’s pre-rendered using `getStaticProps`, Next.js fetches this JSON file (pre-computed at build time) and uses it as the props for the page component. This means that client-side page transitions will **not** call `getStaticProps` as only the exported JSON is used.

When using Incremental Static Generation `getStaticProps` will be executed out of band to generate the JSON needed for client-side navigation. You may see this in the form of multiple requests being made for the same page, however, this is intended and has no impact on end-user performance

## Where can I use getStaticProps

`getStaticProps` can only be exported from a **page**. You **cannot** export it from non-page files.

One of the reasons for this restriction is that React needs to have all the required data before the page is rendered.

Also, you must use export `getStaticProps` as a standalone function — it will **not** work if you add `getStaticProps` as a property of the page component.

## Runs on every request in development

In development (`next dev`), `getStaticProps` will be called on every request.

## Preview Mode

In some cases, you might want to temporarily bypass Static Generation and render the page at **request time** instead of build time. For example, you might be using a headless CMS and want to preview drafts before they're published.

This use case is supported in Next.js by the [**Preview Mode**](/docs/advanced-features/preview-mode.md) feature.
